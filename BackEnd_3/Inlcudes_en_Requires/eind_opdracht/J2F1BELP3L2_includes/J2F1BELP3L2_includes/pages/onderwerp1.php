    <h2>Who is Jerma?</h2>
    <p>
        Jerma985 is a Las Vegas-based comedy and gaming entertainer. He got his start making Grand Theft Auto 4 and Team Fortress 2 videos on his YouTube channel, but has since branched out into a wide variety of audiovisual content and livestreaming on Twitch. The stream allows for Jerma to interact with viewers live, and vice versa. These streams are also recorded and edited for viewers on YouTube as well.

        In the lore, Jerma actually lives in a world of his own creation, parallel to ours, known as the Jermaverse™. The Jermaverse is vast, and filled with incredible amounts of fictional characters... and some real people too, I guess.

        One of the largest facets of the Jermaverse is the Jerma Wrestling Federation, an integrated media and entertainment company that is primarily known for professional wrestling such as the Jerma Rumble and Jermania.

        Through this Jermaverse, Jerma's creative madness has steadily grown; along with the comedic genius he regularly expresses on both YouTube and Twitch, Jerma has birthed something truly special. This Wiki is here to exhibit and celebrate the brainchildren and antics of one of the greatest internet funnymen of all time.

        Jerma has never spoken using his real voice. Fans theorize that his real voice was a supernatural weapon of some kind where upon hearing it, you are immediately transported to a realm of existence that is incomprehensible by the human mind. A realm where you are driven to insanity by immense, Lovecraftian horrors and an infinitely expanding pit of enveloping darkness.

        Jerma lastly lived in an undisclosed location before dying in Záhony, as he has successfully evaded federal surveillance teams via an elaborate catalog of illusions, prerecorded streams, Jerma lookalikes, and holograms. These searches were conducted as part of a global effort to put an end to his murder streak. If you see this man, notify your local authorities immediately and leave the area quickly and discreetly. (AVOID ANY AND ALL CLOWN CARS UNTIL HE IS STOPPED).

        After a Yearly Channel Doctor's Appointment, Jerma gravitated away from YouTube and hasn't made a video on his main channel since, stating that the channel is now an archive and now focusing instead on live streams. His second channel, 2ndJerma, is home to hundreds of stream highlight videos. These were previously edited exclusively by Holy Mackerel the Third and Bellusdaisy, but in 2020 the channel underwent a restructuring where new editors, some of whom were known by the community for their unofficial work, were brought on board to remedy the issue of edited content being very far behind schedule.
